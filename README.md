# scNMT-seq Challenge using mixOmics


# Prerequisites

It would work best if the files are loaded as R project.

The integration file uses a specific branch of `mixOmics` to handle `MultiAssayExperiment` class which can be installed using:

```r
BiocManager::install("mixOmicsTeam/mixOmics@MultiAssayExperiment")
```

Please let me know if any part is not reproducible.
