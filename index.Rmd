# TO Do

* commit changes so tracking is easier
* A way/function to get consistent sample names for assays when creating the diablo's X for rna-promoter-p300-diablo.Rmd and others >> how did Lucy do it? Or how did we do it in the 'explore' file?

# RNA

* [RNA gene filtering based on expression](notebook/filter-rna-data.html)
* [Comparison of normalisation methods for scRNAseq data](notebook/compare-rna-normalisation.html)
* [Add pearson residuals to MAE and rank rna features based on variance](notebook/update-rna-in-mae.html)
<!-- * [Predict unknown lineages using a PLSDA model with RNA data]() -->

# Imputation

* [imputation benchmarkig using means vs NIPALS](notebook/imputation.html)
* [impute MAE](notebook/imputation.html)

# Integration

* [DIABLO - RNA - promoters - enhancers (markers + error rates)](notebook/)
* [MOFA: RNA - promoters - enhancers (markerss)](notebook/)
* [k-means silhouette/purity using block.spls RNA ~ promoters + enhancers vs MOFA variates ](notebook/)
