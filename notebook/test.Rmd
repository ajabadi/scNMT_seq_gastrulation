## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, eval=on_hpc, echo=on_hpc}
## on_hpc is TRUE!
summary(cars)
url_5cl <- url('https://github.com/LuyiTian/CellBench_data/blob/master/data/sincell_with_class_5cl.RData?raw=true')
load(url_5cl)
ls()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
